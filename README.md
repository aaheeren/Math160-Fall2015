Introduction
------------
You are now reading the main course web page.
The paragraphs below serve as the syllabus for Math 160 Sections 4, 6,8.

*This page, as well as the content directory above, and its subdirectories, will
 be updated throughout the semester, and students are expected to visit this
 page periodically.* 

Please bookmark this page or, better yet,

 page to yourself!

The ISU Blackboard system will be used only for recording test scores and
grades. Please Note, the Blackboard system often reports cumulative grade totals
that bear little relation to the course grades as they will be computed at
the end of the semester. If you want to find out where you stand in the class,
please keep track of your grades and refer to the
[Grading Policy](#grading-policy) section below.

Overview, Prerequisites, Outcomes
---------------------------------

**Overview**  
We will cover Chapters 1 through 6 of [the textbook](#textbook),
which includes the following topics:

1. Preliminaries  
2. Functions, Limits, and the Derivative (~9 days)  
3. Differentiation (~15 days)  
4. Applications of the Derivative (~10 days)  
5. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions (~6 days)  
6. Integration (~11 days)  

**Prerequisites**  
Satisfactory performance on placement exam, 2 years of high school algebra, 1
year of geometry.

**Learning Outcomes**  
Generally speaking, students will master concepts and solve problems based on
functions, limits, derivatives, introductory integrals, the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus, and applications of derivatives and integrals. For a more detailed
list of the course objectives, see the appendix section 
[Detailed Course Objectives](#detailed-course-objectives) below, or see the Math
Department's generic Math 160 page at http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/160/

Textbook Information
--------------------
**Title:** Applied Calculus for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences.  
**Author:** Soo Tan  
**Edition:** Looseleaf custom edition + WebAssign access key  
**ISBN:** 9781305754454  

This "discounted" package includes the looseleaf textbook bundled with the
WebAssign access code. The code includes access to the online learning tools and
an electronic version of the book.

**Important Note:** You are required to have a
[WebAssign][] access code so that you can complete the online homework for this
course. It is also highly recommended that you have a hard copy of the
textbook.  Therefore, you are encouraged to buy the bundled version of the (custom
edition of the) book from the bookstore, which comes with both a hard copy of
the book and a WebAssign access code.

Having said that, the cost of the bundled version of the book and access code is
excessive ($268), and it is possible to buy the access code for WebAssign
separately from the textbook, either directly through the [WebAssign website][]
or from the university bookstore for around $82.
In fact, access to WebAssign comes with a (somewhat restricted) electronic
version of the textbook, so it is not absolutely necessary to have a hard copy.

Of course, it is helpful to have a hard copy of the book, or at least an
electronic version that you can view on a tablet when studying in the library.
If you limit yourself to the electronic access provided through WebAssign, you
may find it inconvenient, especially when the network is slow, and as a result
you may end up studying the textbook material less often than you would if you
had purchased a hard copy.

**Which hard copy of the book should you buy?**

The goal of textbook publishers is naturally to sell as many new books as
possible. This goal is more difficult than it used to be because students have
unprecedented access to a massive online used textbook market. Many publishers
counter this challenge by both producing new editions and raising prices at
staggering rates.

The edition that is stocked in the university bookstore is the official textbook
for this course and, unfortunately, it is very expensive.  However, students are
free to use older editions of the book that may be found at online retailers
like Amazon. For example,
[the 9th edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1133607713/)
is probably very similar in content to the edition that is stocked by the
university bookstore.


Exams
-----
There will be two midterm exams each worth 20%, and a final exam worth
25% of the course grade.

+ **MIDTERM EXAM 1** on Chapters 1, 2 and part of 3.  
**DATE:** TBA  
**TIME:** your usual recitation meeting time.  
**LOCATION:** your usual recitation classroom.
  
+ **MIDTERM EXAM 2** on Chapters 3, 4, and part of 5.  
**DATE:** TBA  
**TIME:** your usual recitation meeting time.  
**LOCATION:** your usual recitation classroom.

+ **FINAL EXAM** (cumulative)  
**DATE:** Monday, December 14, 2015.  
**TIME:** 7:30--9:30am.   
**LOCATION:** Carver 0001.

The final exam will be cumulative, that is, it will cover everything we have
learned during the semester.

In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
the date of the final exam.

Quizzes
-------
There will be somewhere between 6 and 8 quizzes administered in the recitations sections.  Your
best 5 quiz scores will account for 15% of the final course grade.

Online Homework
---------------
Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the
tests and quizzes, and ultimately to do well in the course.

The **online homework will account for 20% of the course grade** and will be
assigned about once or twice per week.

All homework for this course will be done with [WebAssign][].
You will enroll yourself in our course by going to the 
[WebAssign website][] and using the following class key:

**WebAssign Class Key:** iastate 8774 8288

The problems assigned and the due dates will be clearly indicated on the
WebAssign website, so students must login frequently and check for newly
assigned homework. (The last assignment will be due during the last week
of the semester, also known as "dead week.")  

**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  

There will be between 15 and 20 online homework assignments during the semester.
The two lowest homework scores will not count toward your final course grade.


Handwritten Homework
--------------------
To get the most out of the homework, and to prepare yourself well for the in-class
(hand-written) tests and exams, it is a very good idea to print out hard copies
of each WebAssign assignment, take these hard copies to a quiet place like the
library, and work on them using a pencil.
Thereafter, you should go through the assignment from the beginning while logged into WebAssign
and submit your answers, using your handwritten notes and solutions as a guide.  

Hand-written work will not be submitted for grading.
However, for the purpose of asking questions about homework in lecture,
recitation section, or office hours, as well as for studying for exams, it can
be very helpful to have printed out hard copies of all the homework assignments.


Make-up Policy
--------------
*There will be no make-up homework or exams.*
If you must miss an exam for a legitimate reason, contact the professor
at least four days prior to the exam date and you might be allowed
to take the exam *before* the scheduled exam time. 

If you miss a test due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).


Grading Policy
--------------
The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ Final exam: 25 points  
+ Mid-term exams: 40 points (20 each)  
+ Homework: 20 points total  
+ Quizzes/Recitation Grade: 15 points

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted,
depending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)
will occur at the end of the semester.  

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    

Attendance
----------
Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused).
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total. Each absence in addition
to that may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.

In many of the lectures, attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in
sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. (If another student asks
you to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature
constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to
the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs.)

If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.


3 Ways to Ask Questions
-----------------------

When you don't understand something, please ask a question!

1. **Lecture** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **Piazza** Another good place to ask a question is online discussion forum.
   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students
   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].

   This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
   classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the
   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). 

   Our class Piazza page is at: https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160/home

3. **WebAssign** Another way to ask a question is by using the "Ask my instructor" link on
   WebAssign. This method is convenient for the teaching staff because details
   about the problem you're asking about are automatically embedded 
   in your email.

   *Please note:* if you use the "Ask my instructor" button, your
   question may be reposted on our [Piazza][] forum (which is public).  If you're
   uncomfortable with this, please say so in your message.


Email Policy
------------
You may email the instructor and TAs directly, though the response
time will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.

If you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 160:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">this
link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should
pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least
indicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.


Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to
this policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to
an electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (WebAssign) homework
problems. Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for
example, is totally unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to
focus on what is being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting 
to other students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated
to calculus will not be tolerated.**

Supplemental Instruction
------------------------
Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an internationally recognized academic support
program offering free, regularly scheduled study sessions for traditionally
difficult courses. Attend once or attend every session...the choice is up to
you, but the data suggests that the more you attend, the higher your final grade
will be in the course. Students are encouraged to attend SI at least once per
week. More information is at https://apps-dso.sws.iastate.edu/si/

Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to
and dealt with by the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs, in a  manner consistent
with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the
university.


Classroom Policy
----------------
In this course, we follow the general university classroom policy: http://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html


Students With Disabilities
--------------------------
If you have a documented disability
or if you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability
Resources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures.

**The Disability Resources Office**  
Student Services Building, Room 1076  
phone: 515-294-6624, or 515-294-7220, or TDD 294-6335  
email: [disabilityresources@iastate.edu](mailto:disabilityresources@iastate.edu) or
[accommodations@iastate.edu](mailto:accommodations@iastate.edu).

You must obtain a Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) from the Disability
Resources office and you must contact your instructor early in the semester so
that your learning needs may be appropriately met. 

Your instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not
provide them retroactively, **so the appropriate requests and paperwork 
should be filed well before the first exam.**

More information about disability resources in the Mathematics Department can be
found at http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/AccommodationPol.html.
