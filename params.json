Please Note, the Blackboard system often reports cumulative grade totals\r\nthat bear little relation to the course grades as they will be computed at\r\nthe end of the semester. If you want to find out where you stand in the class,\r\nplease keep track of your grades and refer to the\r\n[Grading Policy](#grading-policy) section below.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Meeting Times\r\n-------------------\r\n**Lecture:** MWF 8--8:50am Carver 0001.\r\n\r\n**Recitation:**\r\n- Sec 4: T 8--8:50am Carver 0074.  \r\n- Sec 6: T 12:10--1pm Carver 0282.  \r\n- Sec 8: T 9--9:50am Beyer 2308.\r\n\r\nOverview, Prerequisites, Outcomes\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Overview**  \r\nWe will cover Chapters 1 through 6 of [the textbook](#textbook),\r\nwhich includes the following topics:\r\n\r\n1. Preliminaries  \r\n2. Functions, Limits, and the Derivative  \r\n3. Differentiation  \r\n4. Applications of the Derivative  \r\n5. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions  \r\n6. Integration  \r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**  \r\nSatisfactory performance on placement exam, 2 years of high school algebra, 1\r\nyear of geometry.\r\n\r\n**Learning Outcomes**  \r\nGenerally speaking, students will master concepts and solve problems based on\r\nfunctions, limits, derivatives, introductory integrals, the Fundamental Theorem\r\nof Calculus, and applications of derivatives and integrals. For a more detailed\r\nlist of the course objectives, see the appendix section \r\n[Detailed Course Objectives](#detailed-course-objectives) below, or see the Math\r\nDepartment's generic Math 160 page at http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/160/\r\n\r\nTextbook Information\r\n--------------------\r\n**Title:** Applied Calculus for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences.  \r\n**Author:** Soo Tan  \r\n**Edition:** Looseleaf custom edition + WebAssign access key  \r\n**ISBN:** 9781305744295  \r\n\r\nThe bookstore will sell a discounted package that includes the looseleaf\r\ntextbook bundled with a WebAssign access code. The code includes access to the\r\nonline learning tools and an electronic version of the book.\r\n\r\n**Important Note:** You are required to have a\r\n[WebAssign][] access code so that you can complete the online homework for this\r\ncourse. It is also highly recommended that you have a hard copy of the\r\ntextbook.  Therefore, you are encouraged to buy the bundled version of the\r\nbook from the bookstore, which comes with both a hard copy of\r\nthe book and a WebAssign access code.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the version of the textbook you have is not important.\r\nWhat matters most is that you have access to WebAssign.\r\n\r\nFor your reference, the edition of the textbook that your instructor will be\r\nfollowing (since it was provided by the Math Department) is the 9th edition of\r\n\"Applied Calculus for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences: *A Brief Approach*.\"\r\n\r\nFor your reference, here are links to the WebAssign and Amazon pages for the\r\nedition of the textbook that your instructor will use: \r\n\r\n+ [WebAssign Link: http://www.webassign.net/textbooks/TanApCalcBr9/details.html](http://www.webassign.net/textbooks/TanApCalcBr9/details.html)\r\n\r\n+ [Amazon Link: http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Calculus-Managerial-Social-Sciences/dp/0538498900/](http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Calculus-Managerial-Social-Sciences/dp/0538498900/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExams\r\n-----\r\nThere will be three midterm exams each worth 15%, and a final exam worth\r\n25% of the course grade.\r\n\r\n+ **MIDTERM EXAM 1** (focus on Chapters 1 and 2)  \r\n**DATE:** Tuesday, September 22.  \r\n**TIME:** your usual recitation meeting time.  \r\n**LOCATION:** your usual recitation classroom.\r\n  \r\n+ **MIDTERM EXAM 2** (focus on Chapters 3 and 4)  \r\n**DATE:** Tuesday, October 20.  \r\n**TIME:** your usual recitation meeting time.  \r\n**LOCATION:** your usual recitation classroom.\r\n\r\n+ **MIDTERM EXAM 3** (focus on Chapters 5 and 6)  \r\n**DATE:** Tuesday, November 17.  \r\n**TIME:** your usual recitation meeting time.  \r\n**LOCATION:** your usual recitation classroom.\r\n\r\n+ **FINAL EXAM** on Chapters 1--6.  \r\n**DATE:** Monday, December 14, 2015.  \r\n**TIME:** 7:30--9:30am.   \r\n**LOCATION:** Carver 0001.\r\n\r\nThe final exam will be cumulative, that is, it will cover everything we have\r\nlearned during the semester.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be\r\ntaken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before\r\nthe date of the final exam.\r\n\r\nQuizzes\r\n-------\r\nThere will be approximately 11 short quizzes, administered\r\nroughly once per week during recitation.\r\n\r\n**NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES.**  \r\n*Under no circumstances will there be any make-up quizzes.*\r\nTo accommodate circumstances that cause a student to miss a quiz,\r\nthe lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the semester.\r\nThe remaining quizzes will account for 15% of the final course grade.\r\n\r\nOnline Homework\r\n---------------\r\nSolving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the\r\ntests and quizzes, and ultimately to do well in the course.\r\n\r\nThe **online homework will account for 15% of the course grade** and will be\r\nassigned once per week, typically due each Tuesday by midnight.\r\n\r\nAll homework for this course will be done with [WebAssign][].\r\nYou will enroll yourself in our course by going to the \r\n[WebAssign website][] and using the following class key:\r\n\r\n**WebAssign Class Key:** iastate 8774 8288\r\n\r\nThe problems assigned and the due dates will be clearly indicated on the\r\nWebAssign website, so students must login frequently and check for newly\r\nassigned homework. (The last assignment will be due during the last week\r\nof the semester, also known as \"dead week.\")  \r\n\r\n**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  \r\n\r\nThe lowest homework score will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nHandwritten Homework\r\n--------------------\r\nTo get the most out of the homework, and to prepare yourself well for the in-class\r\n(hand-written) tests and exams, it is a very good idea to print out hard copies\r\nof each WebAssign assignment, take these hard copies to a quiet place like the\r\nlibrary, and work on them using a pencil.\r\nThereafter, you should go through the assignment from the beginning while logged into WebAssign\r\nand submit your answers, using your handwritten notes and solutions as a guide.  \r\n\r\nHand-written work will not be submitted for grading.\r\nHowever, for the purpose of asking questions about homework in lecture,\r\nrecitation section, or office hours, as well as for studying for exams, it can\r\nbe very helpful to have printed out hard copies of all the homework assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake-up Policy\r\n--------------\r\n**There are no make-up homework or quizzes for any reason.**  If you must miss\r\na quiz or you fail to submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt\r\nyour course grade since the lowest quiz and homework scores will be dropped.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, \r\nif you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,\r\nand if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,\r\nthen you might be able to take a make-up exam *before* the scheduled exam time.\r\n\r\nTo request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of\r\none of the following:\r\n\r\n+ Medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.\r\n+ Medical excuse - a member of the student's family has a medical emergency.\r\n+ Extra curricular activities as a representative of Iowa State University.\r\n+ Armed forces deployment (military duty).\r\n+ Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.\r\n+ A conflict with another exam or if you have three or more final exams on a\r\ngiven day.  (In each case the exam with the fewest students\r\nmust arrange the make-up exam.)\r\n\r\nIf you miss an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the \r\nprofessor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an\r\nexplanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced \r\nwith 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and\r\nyou score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test\r\n(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).\r\n\r\n\r\nGrading Policy\r\n--------------\r\nThe breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  \r\n\r\n+ Final exam: 25 points  \r\n+ Mid-term exams: 45 points (15 each)  \r\n+ Homework: 15 points total  \r\n+ Quizzes/Recitation Grade: 15 points\r\n\r\nAt the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to\r\nthe following table. However, the scale may be shifted,\r\ndepending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)\r\nwill occur at the end of the semester.  \r\n\r\n+ A: 94--100  \r\n+ A-: 91--93  \r\n+ B+: 87--90   \r\n+ B: 84--86   \r\n+ B-: 81--83   \r\n+ C+: 77--80  \r\n+ C: 74--76   \r\n+ C-: 71--73   \r\n+ D+: 67--70   \r\n+ D: 64--66   \r\n+ D-: 60--63   \r\n+ F:  0--59    \r\n\r\nAttendance\r\n----------\r\nStudents are expected to attend all classes.\r\nA grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences\r\n(whether excused or unexcused).\r\nSpecifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven\r\nabsences in total. Each absence in addition\r\nto that may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.\r\n\r\nIn many of the lectures, attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in\r\nsheet on which you will print and sign your own name. (If another student asks\r\nyou to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature\r\nconstitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to\r\nthe ISU Office of Judicial Affairs.)\r\n\r\nIf you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention\r\nthis to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive\r\nto your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture\r\nis over.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Ways to Ask Questions\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you don't understand something, please ask a question!\r\n\r\n1. **Lecture** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.\r\n\r\n2. **Piazza** Another good place to ask a question is online discussion forum.\r\n   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students\r\n   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].\r\n\r\n   This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from\r\n   classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the\r\n   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.\r\n   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email\r\n   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). \r\n\r\n   Our class Piazza page is at: https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160/home\r\n\r\n3. **WebAssign** Another way to ask a question is by using the \"Ask my instructor\" link on\r\n   WebAssign. This method is convenient for the teaching staff because details\r\n   about the problem you're asking about are automatically embedded \r\n   in your email.\r\n\r\n   *Please note:* if you use the \"Ask my instructor\" button, your\r\n   question may be reposted on our [Piazza][] forum (which is public).  If you're\r\n   uncomfortable with this, please say so in your message.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail Policy\r\n------------\r\nYou may email the instructor and TAs directly, though the response\r\ntime will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\nIf you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.\r\nIf you use <a href=\"mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 160:\r\n(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)\">this\r\nlink</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should\r\npre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least\r\nindicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse of Electronics During Lecture\r\n---------------------------------\r\nSilence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,\r\nmicrowave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to\r\nthis policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to\r\nan electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (WebAssign) homework\r\nproblems. Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for\r\nexample, is totally unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to\r\nfocus on what is being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting \r\nto other students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated\r\nto calculus will not be tolerated.**\r\n\r\nSupplemental Instruction\r\n------------------------\r\nSupplemental Instruction (SI) is an internationally recognized academic support\r\nprogram offering free, regularly scheduled study sessions for traditionally\r\ndifficult courses. Attend once or attend every session...the choice is up to\r\nyou, but the data suggests that the more you attend, the higher your final grade\r\nwill be in the course. Students are encouraged to attend SI at least once per\r\nweek. More information is at https://apps-dso.sws.iastate.edu/si/\r\n\r\nAcademic Honesty\r\n----------------\r\nCheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to\r\nand dealt with by the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs, in a  manner consistent\r\nwith university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassroom Policy\r\n----------------\r\nIn this course, we follow the general university classroom policy: http://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents With Disabilities\r\n--------------------------\r\nIf you have a documented disability\r\nor if you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\r\nAct and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability\r\nResources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures.\r\n\r\n**The Disability Resources Office**  \r\nStudent Services Building, Room 1076  \r\nphone: 515-294-6624, or 515-294-7220, or TDD 294-6335  \r\nemail: [disabilityresources@iastate.edu](mailto:disabilityresources@iastate.edu) or\r\n[accommodations@iastate.edu](mailto:accommodations@iastate.edu).\r\n\r\nYou must obtain a Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) from the Disability\r\nResources office and you must contact your instructor early in the semester so\r\nthat your learning needs may be appropriately met. \r\n\r\nYour instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not\r\nprovide them retroactively, **so the appropriate requests and paperwork \r\nshould be filed well before the first exam.**\r\n\r\nMore information about disability resources in the Mathematics Department can be\r\nfound at http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/AccommodationPol.html. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n# Appendix\r\n\r\nDetailed Course Objectives\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n**Functions, Limits and Continuity**\r\n- Understand what a function is, and the relationship of a function to its graph\r\n- Understand intuitively what the limit of a function is\r\n- Apply rules to calculate simple limits\r\n- Understand the intuitive meaning of continuity of a function at a point\r\n- Use the limit concept to determine where a function is continuous.\r\n- Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to identify an interval where a continuous function has a root.\r\n\r\n**Differentiation**\r\n- Use the limit definition to calculate a derivative, or to determine when a derivative fails to exist.\r\n- Understand and use rules for the derivative of sums, products, and quotients\r\n- Understand and use the chain rule for computing the derivative of a composite function\r\n- Rules for computing derivatives of logarithmic and exponential functions\r\n- Rules for inverse functions, including logarithms and inverse trignometric functions.\r\n- Use the derivative to find tangent lines to curves.\r\n- Calculate derivatives of functions defined implicitly.\r\n- Interpret the derivative as a rate of change.\r\n- Solve problems involving rates of change of variables subject to a functional relationship (“related rates”)\r\n\r\n**Applications of Derivatives**\r\n- Find critical points, and use them to locate maxima and minima.\r\n- Use critical points and signs of first and second derivatives to sketch graphs of functions:\r\n- Use the first derivative to find intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing.\r\n- Use the second derivative to determine concavity and find inflection points.\r\n- Apply the first and second derivative tests to classify critical points.\r\n- Use calculus to solve simple optimization problems in business and economics (marginal profit, etc.)\r\n- Use Differential Calculus to solve other kinds of optimization problems.\r\n\r\n**Integration**\r\n- Find antiderivatives of functions.\r\n- Use antiderivatives to solve simple differential equations (variables separable)\r\n- Understand the concept of area under a curve, and the connection with antiderivatives given by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\r\n- Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate definite integrals\r\n- Evaluate definite integrals by certain simple rules (substitution, integration by parts, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Resources\r\n--------------------\r\n+ [Piazza][]\r\n+ [WebAssign][]\r\n+ [ISU Math Department](http://www.math.iastate.edu/)\r\n+ [ISU Math Course Pages](http://www.math.iastate.edu/Directories/CoursePages.html)\r\n+ [Math Stackexchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/)\r\n\r\n[Piazza]: https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160/home\r\n[Piazza page]: https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160/home\r\n[Piazza signup page]: https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160\r\n[MyLabsPlus]: http://www.iastate.mylabsplus.com\r\n[MyLabsPlus website]: http://www.iastate.mylabsplus.com\r\n[WebAssign]: http://www.webassign.net\r\n[WebAssign website]: http://www.webassign.net\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
