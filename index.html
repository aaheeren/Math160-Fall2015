of Calculus, and applications of derivatives and integrals. For a more detailed
list of the course objectives, see the appendix section 
<a href="#detailed-course-objectives">Detailed Course Objectives</a> below, or see the Math
Department's generic Math 160 page at <a href="http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/160/">http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/160/</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="textbook-information" class="anchor" href="#textbook-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Textbook Information</h2>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Applied Calculus for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences.<br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Soo Tan<br>
<strong>Edition:</strong> Looseleaf custom edition + WebAssign access key<br>
<strong>ISBN:</strong> 9781305744295  </p>

<p>The bookstore will sell a discounted package that includes the looseleaf
textbook bundled with a WebAssign access code. The code includes access to the
online learning tools and an electronic version of the book.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> You are required to have a
<a href="http://www.webassign.net">WebAssign</a> access code so that you can complete the online homework for this
course. It is also highly recommended that you have a hard copy of the
textbook.  Therefore, you are encouraged to buy the bundled version of the
book from the bookstore, which comes with both a hard copy of
the book and a WebAssign access code.</p>

<p>Having said that, the version of the textbook you have is not important.
What matters most is that you have access to WebAssign.</p>

<p>For your reference, the edition of the textbook that your instructor will be
following (since it was provided by the Math Department) is the 9th edition of
"Applied Calculus for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences: <em>A Brief Approach</em>."</p>

<p>For your reference, here are links to the WebAssign and Amazon pages for the
edition of the textbook that your instructor will use: </p>

</ul>

<h2>
<a id="exams" class="anchor" href="#exams" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exams</h2>

<p>There will be three midterm exams each worth 15%, and a final exam worth
25% of the course grade.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>MIDTERM EXAM 1</strong> (focus on Chapters 1 and 2)<br>
<strong>DATE:</strong> Tuesday, September 22.<br>
<strong>TIME:</strong> your usual recitation meeting time.<br>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> your usual recitation classroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MIDTERM EXAM 2</strong> (focus on Chapters 3 and 4)<br>
<strong>DATE:</strong> Tuesday, October 20.<br>
<strong>TIME:</strong> your usual recitation meeting time.<br>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> your usual recitation classroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MIDTERM EXAM 3</strong> (focus on Chapters 5 and 6)<br>
<strong>DATE:</strong> Tuesday, November 17.<br>
<strong>TIME:</strong> your usual recitation meeting time.<br>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> your usual recitation classroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FINAL EXAM</strong> on Chapters 1--6.<br>
<strong>DATE:</strong> Monday, December 14, 2015.<br>
<strong>TIME:</strong> 7:30--9:30am.<br>
<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Carver 0001.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The final exam will be cumulative, that is, it will cover everything we have
learned during the semester.</p>

<p>In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
the date of the final exam.</p>

<h2>
<a id="quizzes" class="anchor" href="#quizzes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quizzes</h2>

<p>There will be approximately 11 short quizzes, administered
roughly once per week during recitation.</p>

<p><strong>NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES.</strong><br>
<em>Under no circumstances will there be any make-up quizzes.</em>
To accommodate circumstances that cause a student to miss a quiz,
the lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the semester.
The remaining quizzes will account for 15% of the final course grade.</p>

<h2>
<a id="online-homework" class="anchor" href="#online-homework" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Online Homework</h2>

<p>Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the
tests and quizzes, and ultimately to do well in the course.</p>

<p>The <strong>online homework will account for 15% of the course grade</strong> and will be
assigned once per week, typically due each Tuesday by midnight.</p>

<p>All homework for this course will be done with <a href="http://www.webassign.net">WebAssign</a>.
You will enroll yourself in our course by going to the 
<a href="http://www.webassign.net">WebAssign website</a> and using the following class key:</p>

<p><strong>WebAssign Class Key:</strong> iastate 8774 8288</p>

<p>The problems assigned and the due dates will be clearly indicated on the
WebAssign website, so students must login frequently and check for newly
assigned homework. (The last assignment will be due during the last week
of the semester, also known as "dead week.")  </p>

<p><strong>Late homework will not be accepted or graded.</strong>  </p>

<p>The lowest homework score will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.</p>

<h2>
<a id="handwritten-homework" class="anchor" href="#handwritten-homework" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Handwritten Homework</h2>

<p>To get the most out of the homework, and to prepare yourself well for the in-class
(hand-written) tests and exams, it is a very good idea to print out hard copies
of each WebAssign assignment, take these hard copies to a quiet place like the
library, and work on them using a pencil.
Thereafter, you should go through the assignment from the beginning while logged into WebAssign
and submit your answers, using your handwritten notes and solutions as a guide.  </p>

<p>Hand-written work will not be submitted for grading.
However, for the purpose of asking questions about homework in lecture,
recitation section, or office hours, as well as for studying for exams, it can
be very helpful to have printed out hard copies of all the homework assignments.</p>

<h2>
<a id="make-up-policy" class="anchor" href="#make-up-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Make-up Policy</h2>

<p><strong>There are no make-up homework or quizzes for any reason.</strong>  If you must miss
a quiz or you fail to submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt
your course grade since the lowest quiz and homework scores will be dropped.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, 
if you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,
and if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,
then you might be able to take a make-up exam <em>before</em> the scheduled exam time.</p>

<p>To request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of
one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.</li>
<li>Medical excuse - a member of the student's family has a medical emergency.</li>
<li>Extra curricular activities as a representative of Iowa State University.</li>
<li>Armed forces deployment (military duty).</li>
<li>Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.</li>
<li>A conflict with another exam or if you have three or more final exams on a
given day.  (In each case the exam with the fewest students
must arrange the make-up exam.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you miss an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).</p>

<h2>
<a id="grading-policy" class="anchor" href="#grading-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading Policy</h2>

<p>The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Final exam: 25 points<br>
</li>
<li>Mid-term exams: 45 points (15 each)<br>
</li>
<li>Homework: 15 points total<br>
</li>
<li>Quizzes/Recitation Grade: 15 points</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted,
depending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)
will occur at the end of the semester.  </p>

<ul>
<li>A: 94--100<br>
</li>
<li>A-: 91--93<br>
</li>
<li>B+: 87--90<br>
</li>
<li>B: 84--86<br>
</li>
<li>B-: 81--83<br>
</li>
<li>C+: 77--80<br>
</li>
<li>C: 74--76<br>
</li>
<li>C-: 71--73<br>
</li>
<li>D+: 67--70<br>
</li>
<li>D: 64--66<br>
</li>
<li>D-: 60--63<br>
</li>
<li>F:  0--59<br>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="attendance" class="anchor" href="#attendance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attendance</h2>

<p>Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused).
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total. Each absence in addition
to that may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.</p>

<p>In many of the lectures, attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in
sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. (If another student asks
you to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature
constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to
the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs.)</p>

<p>If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.</p>

<h2>
<a id="3-ways-to-ask-questions" class="anchor" href="#3-ways-to-ask-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3 Ways to Ask Questions</h2>

<p>When you don't understand something, please ask a question!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lecture</strong> The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Piazza</strong> Another good place to ask a question is online discussion forum.
This term we will be using <a href="https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160/home">Piazza</a> for class discussion and all students
should enroll in this forum by visiting the <a href="https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160">Piazza signup page</a>.</p>

<p>This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the
teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
<a href="mailto:team@piazza.com">team@piazza.com</a>. </p>

<p>Our class Piazza page is at: <a href="https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160/home">https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160/home</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WebAssign</strong> Another way to ask a question is by using the "Ask my instructor" link on
WebAssign. This method is convenient for the teaching staff because details
about the problem you're asking about are automatically embedded 
in your email.</p>

<p><em>Please note:</em> if you use the "Ask my instructor" button, your
question may be reposted on our <a href="https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math160/home">Piazza</a> forum (which is public).  If you're
uncomfortable with this, please say so in your message.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="email-policy" class="anchor" href="#email-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Email Policy</h2>

<p>You may email the instructor and TAs directly, though the response
time will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.</p>

<p>If you email the instructor, you <em>must</em> use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH%20160:%0A(fill%20in%20subject%20here)&amp;body=Dear%20Dr.%20DeMeo,%20(your%20message)%20Sincerely,%20(your%20full%20name)">this
link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should
pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least
indicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.</p>

<h2>
<a id="use-of-electronics-during-lecture" class="anchor" href="#use-of-electronics-during-lecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use of Electronics During Lecture</h2>

<p>Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to
this policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to
an electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (WebAssign) homework
problems. Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for
example, is totally unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to
focus on what is being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting 
to other students. <strong>Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated
to calculus will not be tolerated.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a id="supplemental-instruction" class="anchor" href="#supplemental-instruction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supplemental Instruction</h2>

<p>Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an internationally recognized academic support
program offering free, regularly scheduled study sessions for traditionally
difficult courses. Attend once or attend every session...the choice is up to
you, but the data suggests that the more you attend, the higher your final grade
will be in the course. Students are encouraged to attend SI at least once per
week. More information is at <a href="https://apps-dso.sws.iastate.edu/si/">https://apps-dso.sws.iastate.edu/si/</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="academic-honesty" class="anchor" href="#academic-honesty" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to
and dealt with by the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs, in a  manner consistent
with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the
university.</p>

<h2>
<a id="classroom-policy" class="anchor" href="#classroom-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Classroom Policy</h2>

<p>In this course, we follow the general university classroom policy: <a href="http://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html">http://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="students-with-disabilities" class="anchor" href="#students-with-disabilities" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Students With Disabilities</h2>

<p>If you have a documented disability
or if you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability
Resources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures.</p>

<p><strong>The Disability Resources Office</strong><br>
Student Services Building, Room 1076<br>
phone: 515-294-6624, or 515-294-7220, or TDD 294-6335<br>
email: <a href="mailto:disabilityresources@iastate.edu">disabilityresources@iastate.edu</a> or
<a href="mailto:accommodations@iastate.edu">accommodations@iastate.edu</a>.</p>

<p>You must obtain a Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) from the Disability
Resources office and you must contact your instructor early in the semester so
that your learning needs may be appropriately met. </p>

<p>Your instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not
provide them retroactively, <strong>so the appropriate requests and paperwork 
should be filed well before the first exam.</strong></p>
